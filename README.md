# Arvis Demo Day Project - YÄ±ldÄ±zlarÄ±n Akademisi
This project was developed as part of the Arvis DeepTech AI Internship Program. Our team created a 3D short film titled "YÄ±ldÄ±z TozlarÄ±" that integrates visual and auditory generative AI to introduce Arvis Teknoloji. The project aimed to showcase our knowledge of artificial intelligence, including image processing, sound generation, and video editing, all within a creative narrative.

# ðŸŽ¬ Project Overview
In this project, we focused on:

Using Stable Diffusion for generating visuals.
Utilizing Runway and CapCut for video creation and editing.
Incorporating AI-generated voice using ElevenLabs for character dialogues.
Implementing lip sync with AI tools to enhance the speaking scenes.
Our video introduces Arvis Teknoloji, guided by a character exploring futuristic landscapes while narrating the company's journey and mission.

# ðŸš€ Technologies Used
